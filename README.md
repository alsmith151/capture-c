# CCanalyser

## Analysis software for Capture-C, Tri-C and Tiled-C data.

CCanalyser is a tool designed to automate the processing of Capture-C, Tri-C and Tiled-C data from fastq files. The package is effectively a re-implementation of [CCseqBasicS](https://github.com/Hughes-Genome-Group/CCseqBasicS) that combines [CaptureCompare](https://github.com/djdownes/CaptureCompare). 

The package is entirely written in python and  consists of a highly configurable data processing pipline and supporting command line interface to enable finer grained control.
